A single binary. Zero infrastructure. PlanDB gives AI agents a compound task graph — recursive hierarchy with cross-level dependencies — so they can decompose complex work, parallelize safely, and adapt plans mid-flight. The graph structure itself is the scheduling algorithm: `ready` = run now, `pending` = blocked, multiple `ready` = parallelize.

## Autonomous Experimentation: One Agent, One Prompt, Zero Human Code

We gave a single Claude Code instance one sentence: *"Build a GPT from scratch in Rust, then train it to do tool calling."* PlanDB handled the rest.

The agent autonomously built a **3,769-line transformer with full backpropagation** in pure Rust (no ML frameworks), then designed and executed a **7-method RL experiment** comparing SFT, REINFORCE, DPO, rejection sampling, and more. The task graph evolved from 6 planned tasks to 20 through mid-flight adaptation — splitting tasks when they proved complex, spawning parallel workers for independent experiments, and pivoting when REINFORCE catastrophically collapsed.

## Why PlanDB

| The problem | What PlanDB does |
|---|---|
| **Your agent can't think beyond one step.** It finishes a task and forgets the big picture. | The graph IS the big picture. Every task knows what depends on it, what it depends on, and where it sits in the hierarchy. |
| **You can't parallelize safely.** Two agents grab the same work, or one starts before its dependency finishes. | Atomic claiming + dependency enforcement. `plandb list --status ready` = exactly what's safe to parallelize right now. |
| **Plans break on contact with reality.** Agent discovers something mid-flight, but the plan is frozen. | Split, insert, pivot, replan — six mid-flight adaptation primitives. The graph evolves as the agent learns. |
| **Flat task lists can't model real work.** "Backend" depends on "Schema" but also on "Auth" from a different team. | Compound graph: containment (hierarchy) and dependencies (flow) are orthogonal. Cross-level deps just work. |
| **You have no idea what's blocking everything.** Agent is busy, but is it on the critical path? | `plandb critical-path` shows the longest chain. `plandb bottlenecks` shows what's blocking the most work. `plandb what-unlocks` shows impact. |
| **Agent output quality is hope-based.** You pray it checked its work. | Pre/post conditions on every task. Post-condition shown on completion: "verify this before moving on." |
| **Every project starts from zero.** Same decomposition patterns reinvented every time. | `plandb export` saves a project's structure as a template. `plandb import` applies it. Best decompositions compound. |

## Copy-Paste Prompt for Your Agent

Generate a ready-to-use system prompt for any AI agent:

```bash
plandb prompt --for cli    # system prompt for CLI agents (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Aider)
plandb prompt --for mcp    # MCP config JSON for Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf
plandb prompt --for http   # REST API instructions for custom agents
```

Or copy this minimal prompt into your agent's instructions:

```
You have plandb installed for task planning. Use it to decompose work and track progress.

Core loop:    plandb go → work → plandb done --next
Add tasks:    plandb add "title" --description "detailed spec" --dep t-xxx
Split:        plandb split --into "A, B, C" (independent) or "A > B > C" (chain)
Introspect:   plandb critical-path | plandb bottlenecks | plandb what-unlocks <id>
Status:       plandb status --detail

After each completion, reassess: plandb status --detail + plandb critical-path.
Plans are hypotheses — adapt as you learn.
When plandb list --status ready shows multiple tasks, parallelize them.
```

See [examples/](examples/) for complete scripts running PlanDB with Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI.

## What Makes It Different

### Compound Graph

Two orthogonal structures composed together — more general than a DAG, hierarchical DAG, or hypergraph:

- **Place graph** (containment): tasks contain subtasks recursively, to any depth
- **Link graph** (dependencies): edges between tasks at ANY level, crossing containment boundaries

A subtask at depth 3 can depend on a task at depth 0 in a different branch. Nesting doesn't constrain flow. Composite tasks auto-complete when all children finish.

### Zero-Friction Core Loop

```bash
plandb go          # claim next ready task (no --agent needed, no IDs)
plandb done --next # complete current + claim next
```

### Graph-Aware Intelligence

```bash
plandb critical-path       # what to prioritize — longest chain to completion
plandb bottlenecks         # what's blocking the most downstream work
plandb what-unlocks t-abc  # impact of completing a specific task
plandb watch               # live dashboard
```

### Dynamic Adaptation

Plans are hypotheses. Agents discover reality during execution — new tasks emerge, dependencies shift, approaches change. PlanDB has six mid-flight primitives:

```bash
plandb split --into "A, B, C"                # decompose a task that turned out complex
plandb task insert --after t-a --before t-b   # add a missed step, rewire deps automatically
plandb task pivot t-abc --file new.yaml       # replace an entire subtree with a new approach
plandb task amend t-abc --prepend "NOTE: ..."  # annotate future tasks with discoveries
plandb task replan t-abc --file revised.yaml  # cancel + recreate subtasks
plandb what-if cancel t-abc                   # preview effects before committing
```

The graph reshapes itself as agents learn. Dependencies rewire. Ready tasks recalculate. No replanning ceremony — just mutate and go.

### Quality Gates

```bash
plandb add "Implement API" \
  --pre "schema must define all endpoints" \
  --post "all routes return valid JSON" \
  --description "..."
```

### Reusable Decompositions

```bash
plandb export > fullstack.yaml    # save a successful project's structure
plandb import fullstack.yaml      # apply pattern to new project
```

## CLI Reference

### Task Lifecycle

```bash
plandb init "project"                                     # create project
plandb add "title" --description "spec" --dep t-xxx       # add task
plandb add "title" --as custom-id --kind code             # custom ID, typed
plandb go                                                  # claim next ready
plandb done --next                                         # complete + claim next
plandb done --result '{"key": "value"}'                   # complete with data
```

### Decomposition

```bash
plandb split --into "A, B, C"                              # independent subtasks
plandb split --into "A > B > C"                            # linear chain
plandb task decompose t-abc --file subtasks.yaml           # from YAML
plandb use t-abc                                           # scope into subtree
plandb use ..                                              # scope out
```

### Introspection

```bash
plandb status --detail                                     # dependency tree
plandb status --full                                       # compound graph view
plandb critical-path                                       # longest chain
plandb bottlenecks                                         # blocking tasks
plandb what-unlocks t-abc                                  # downstream impact
plandb watch                                               # live dashboard
```

### Plan Adaptation

```bash
plandb task insert --after t-a --before t-b --title "X"   # insert step
plandb task amend t-abc --prepend "NOTE: ..."              # annotate
plandb task pivot t-abc --file new-plan.yaml               # replace subtree
plandb what-if cancel t-abc                                # preview effects
plandb export > template.yaml                              # save pattern
plandb import template.yaml                                # apply pattern
```

### Multi-Agent

```bash
PLANDB_AGENT=w1 plandb go          # atomic claim (no double-assignment)
PLANDB_AGENT=w1 plandb done --next
```

### Constraints

- `--kind`: `generic`, `code`, `research`, `review`, `test`, `shell`
- `--dep`: upstream must exist first. Types: `feeds_into` (default), `blocks`, `suggests`
- `--description`: always include — it's the work order, not the title
- IDs: short (`t-k3m9`), custom (`--as api` → `t-api`), fuzzy-matched on typos

## Interfaces

| Interface | Command | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| CLI | `plandb <command>` | Direct agent use |
| MCP | `plandb mcp` | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf |
| HTTP | `plandb serve --port 8484` | Custom agents, webhooks |

## Architecture

PlanDB uses a **compound graph** — see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design: why two orthogonal structures, cross-level dependency mechanics, comparison with flat DAGs/hypergraphs, composite auto-completion, and when each structure matters.
